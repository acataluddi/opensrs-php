# OpenSRS-PHP

A PHP-based client class that communicates with the OpenSRS API.


## NOTICE

I just moved the project from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opensrs-php/)
to Github to keep all my open-source projects in one place.

I'm sure there are better options out there for communicating with OpenSRS from PHP.
I haven't worked at [Tucows/OpenSRS](http://opensrs.com) or [easyDNS](http://easydns.com)
for quite a while, and haven't used this code since then.

This library isn't maintained by me anymore, so feel free to fork it if you have
improvements. I will accept pull requests.

Enjoy!
